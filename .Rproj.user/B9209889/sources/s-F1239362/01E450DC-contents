# Part 1 Peguins

Load the `palmerpenguins` package and see the `penguins` data.
```{r loading data}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins.df <- penguins
View(penguins)
```

Find the range, mean, median and variance of variable `bill_length_mm`.   
  Range: 32.1-59.6
  Mean: 43.92
  Median: 44.45
  Variance: 29.81
```{r parameters}
range_bill_length <- range(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_bill_length <- mean(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
median_bill_length <- median(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
var_bill_length <- var(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

range_bill_length
mean_bill_length
median_bill_length
var_bill_length
```

What is the standard error of the mean of `bill_length_mm`.
  Standard error: 0.29
```{r standard error}
sd_bill_length <- sd(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
SE_bill_length <- sd_bill_length/sqrt(344)
SE_bill_length
```

Plot a histogram of variable `bill_length_mm`
Mark the position of the mean and median.
```{r plotting}
histogram_penguin <- hist(penguins.df$bill_length_mm) +
  abline(v = mean_bill_length,
         col = "blue",
         lwd = "2") +
  abline(v = median_bill_length,
         col = "red",
         lwd = "2")
histogram_penguin
```

Plot `bill_length_mm` against `bill_depth_mm`
```{r plotting}
plot_penguin <- penguins.df %>% ggplot(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)")
plot_penguin
```


Find the covariance and correlation of `bill_length_mm` against `bill_depth_mm`.
Is the correlation significant? (hint use cor.test())
  Yes, it is significant. The null hypothesis is rejected
```{r finding covariance}
covariance <- cov(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, penguins.df$bill_depth_mm, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
covariance

correlation <- cor(penguins.df$bill_length_mm, penguins.df$bill_depth_mm, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
correlation

cor.test(x=penguins.df$bill_length_mm, y=penguins.df$bill_depth_mm, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
cor.test

```


How should the p-value be interpreted?
  If P-value is less than 0.05, then null hypothesis rejected.
```{r p-value}

```

There are three levels in factor `species` Plot `bill_length_mm` against `bill_depth_mm`, coloured by `species`
  done
```{r plotting}

```

Is the correlation between `bill_length_mm` against `bill_depth_mm` significant for any of the groups?
  
```{r correlation}

```

This is a sub-group analysis, what are the dangers of this type of analysis?
```{r analysis}

```

# Part 2 not penguins

Install the `datasauRus` package with `install.packages("datasauRus")` and load it with `library`.

Dataset `datasaurus_dozen` has `x` and `y` variables and a dataset name. 
For each dataset, calculate the mean and standard deviation of x and y and the correlationn between x and y.
